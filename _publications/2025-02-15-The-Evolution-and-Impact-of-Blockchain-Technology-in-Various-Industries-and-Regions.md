Blockchain technology has rapidly ascended from a niche innovation to a transformative force across multiple sectors. As a decentralized, immutable digital ledger, it has redefined online transactions by eliminating the need for central authorities. Over the past decade, blockchain has revolutionized finance, politics, and stock exchanges, laying the groundwork for future transactional frameworks. Despite its potential, blockchain faces challenges such as scalability, regulatory gaps, and the anonymity of its operations. Addressing these issues through enhanced consensus protocols and stricter regulations is crucial. In India, blockchain's applications span governance, cybersecurity, banking, and finance, with collaborative efforts from both private and public sectors. This paper provides a comprehensive exploration of blockchain's evolution, its profound impact, and its global expansion over recent decades.
